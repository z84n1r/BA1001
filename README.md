1.3         Subject descriptionTime, Truth   and the   Human   Condition   is a   level   1 core subject   in the   Bachelor   of Arts   which   investigates      ideas of   'truth' and   'ways of   knowing'as they develop   in the   contexts   of   cultures,   times   and   places,   both   historical and contemporary, and through   a   range of   perspectives   on   humanity,   and   with   some
emphasis on the experiences of the   peoples of the   tropical   world.   In   examining   the   relationship

identity   is experienced, students will encounter different   traditions   of   thought,   and   develop   skills   in
utilising academic   resources, evaluating and analysing   complex   ideas,   and   communicating   in   a   range   of   media.

   Generative AI   useGenerative AI tools cannot   be   used   in this assessment taskIn this assessment, you   must   not   use Generative Artificial   Intelligence   (GenAI) for   anyelements of the assessment task   including the generation   of any   materials   or   content   in   relation to the assessment   item.
ASSESSMENT   ITEM   1:   DESCRIPTIONParticipation   is   a   basic   requirement   of   many   subjects   in   the    Bachelor   of   Arts,   and   the   skills   gained   in   Workshop participation or Online Activities are critical to development of oral and written communication   skills   throughout   your   studies.   In   Time,   Truth   and   the   Human   Condition,   in   particular,   understanding   of   lectures   and   reading   material   is   facilitated   through   interaction   with   peers   and   the   tutor    in   discussions   and/or online activities.    It is both fun   and very   strengthening   in terms   of   students’   interpersonal   skill   base   for   higher   learning,   and   in   gaining   awareness   of   the   requirements   of   assessments   and   subject   learning   outcomes.   Participation   is   compulsory   and   assessed   in Time, Truth   and the   Human   Condition. Tutors will   maintain a weekly record of attendance and   record a weekly grade for each student. These grades will   not   be   routinely   advised   each   week,   but   students   may   contact   the   tutor   for   updates   on   their   grades   and   progress at   anytime.Preparation for each week’s Workshop   involves accessing and viewing the   recorded   lecture for the week,   and completing thesetreading –   and this means accessing the lectures and readings before the workshop.   Endeavour to demonstrate   in class each week that you   have engaged with the   lectures   and   readings,   and   participate   actively   by   asking   questions,   and   answering   questions   posed   by   the   tutor   and   collaborating   and   engaging with your   peers.   Simply   attending   is   not   enough   to   pass   Participation. You   must   show that   you are engaging with the subject   materials and are willing to interact with your peers   and tutors to share   ideas and information about the lecture topics and assessments. As a ‘rule of thumb’, aim to make at least   one    comment    in    each    week’s    class, and there will be plenty of opportunity   to do so.   Review   the   assessment criteria overleaf for further guidelines.Important note for all students: Data analytics enable the tutor to see if a student has accessed the lecture   recording.   You   will   not   be   entitled   to   full   marks   for   Participation   if   you   have   not   attended   to   both   the   lecture and the   Participation activities   in each week.   In the event that you are   unable to   access   lectures   or   attend   and   participate   in   Workshops   due   to   illness   or   serious   personal   circumstances,    lodge   a   Special   Consideration   application   as   soon   as   practicable   before,   or   immediately   after,   the   session   you   miss   and   provide   a   medical   certificate   or   other   suitable   documentation   -   see   Section   3.3   ‘Special   Consideration   (including deferrals and extensions)’ in this Subject Outline.   Only with   relevant documentation   of   absence   can   alternative activities in   lieu   be arranged to   make   up the   grade.
